	was introduced?

It was really cool...didn't know that was possible in Command Prompt; faster
to find error too.

It'll be easy to revert to earlier bug-free versions/implementations.

	Google docs does?

The commits would be logical, documenting features/bug fixing.

Hmm, a change may involve changing all those files, so it's more logical.

> How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of 
	files?

git log
	shows all commits with id

git diff
	comapres 2 ids and shows additions/deletions

> How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
	could break something?

You have a backup in which the program worked.

Source code management.
