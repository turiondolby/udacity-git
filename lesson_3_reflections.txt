To aid collaboration.

	automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
Because local changes may be overwritten/lost :/

> Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
	When would you use one instead of another?
	
forks
	used on GitHub site to clone someone's repository

clones
	used to clone repository to local computer
	
branches
	used to add/test new features and have a working version on master branches
	can merge new branch to master once complete

revert to a previous version
comparison to see what was changed

	and what would be harder?
	
I'd use Skype + Dropbox.
Less unified way of working...more versions floating around on the Desktop lol.

I'd say mainly for collaboration and personal work respectively.
You'd always have a working version of the product.
Merge conflicts are the main issue with directly modifying master.
